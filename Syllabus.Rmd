<h1 class="hi text-2xl center coral">ECON 3070: Intermediate Microeconomics</h1>

This course introduces the theoretical framework for analyzing the economic behavior of individual decision-makers, such as consumers, workers, and firms. This theoretical framework will be referenced throughout your undergraduate economics education. The aim of this course is to teach you to be able to think about **incentives** and **trade-offs** like an economist.

The course will be divided into 6 sections. The first section will be an introduction to microeconomics, along with a review of supply/demand and calculus. Section 2 will discuss consumer behavior and market demand. We will look at how a consumer chooses how to allocate their scare resources. Section 3 will cover producer behavior and market supply. We will consider how a producing firm chooses the number of inputs it uses, and the amount of output it produces for the market. Section 4 will deal with markets in which individual firms have no market power, and we will learn how prices are set in these markets. In Section 5 we consider different market structures, such as monopolies and oligopolies.

## Grading

<div style="min-height: 2rem;"></div>

```{r grading-summary, echo = F}
grades <- tribble(
  ~Assignment, ~Percentage,
  "<b>Assignments</b>", .30, 
  "<b>Midterms</b>", .3,
  "<b>Final</b>", .40
) %>%
  mutate(
    Assignment = map(Assignment, gt::html)
  )

gt(grades) %>%
  fmt_percent(columns = c("Percentage"), decimals = 0) %>%
  gt::cols_width(
    Assignment ~ px(80),
    Percentage ~ px(30),
  ) %>%
  gt::cols_align(align = "left") %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    data_row.padding = px(2),
    table.font.size = px(10),
    column_labels.hidden = TRUE,
    column_labels.border.bottom.width = px(1)
  )
```

<div style="min-height: 2rem;"></div>

We will have two midterms in the class. The final exam will be cumulative, but more more heavily weighted towards the most recent material. I will curve each midterm separately. After the final exam I will curve the final grades so that the average grade for the whole class is an 81 (B-). The curve follows a strict formula, and I will not manually adjust grades for any reason. Letter grades are assigned according to the standard numerical formula used at CU:

<div style="min-height: 2rem;"></div>


```{r letter-grades, echo = F}
grades <- tribble(
  ~Grade, ~Percentage, ~Blank, ~Grade2, ~Percentage2,
			"A ", "\\(93 \\leq x\\)",      "", "C", "\\(73 \\leq x < 77\\)",
			"A-", "\\(90 \\leq x < 93\\)", "", "C-", "\\(70 \\leq x < 73\\)",
			"B+", "\\(87 \\leq x < 90\\)", "", "D+", "\\(67 \\leq x < 70\\)",
			"B ", "\\(83 \\leq x < 87\\)", "", "D ", "\\(63 \\leq x < 67\\)",
			"B-", "\\(80 \\leq x < 83\\)", "", "D-", "\\(60 \\leq x < 63\\)",
			"C+", "\\(77 \\leq x < 80\\)", "", "F ", "\\(x < 60\\)",        
)

gt(grades) %>%
  gt::cols_width(
    Grade ~ px(30),
    Grade2 ~ px(30),
    Percentage ~ px(80),
    Percentage2 ~ px(70),
    Blank ~ px(20)
  ) %>%
  gt::cols_align(align = "left") %>%
  gt::tab_style(
    style = list(cell_borders(
      sides = c("left"),
      color = "#D3D3D3",
      weight = px(2)
    )),
    locations = list(cells_body(columns = Blank))
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    data_row.padding = px(2),
    table.font.size = px(10),
    column_labels.hidden = TRUE,
    column_labels.border.bottom.width = px(1)
  )
```

<div style="min-height: 2rem;"></div>


### Assignments

For each chapter of material we cover, you will be assigned a problem set that works through the chapter's material. These are essential for practicing the material and learning the techniques you will use throughout your undergraduate career. For grading these assignments, I will select a subset of questions to grade for correctness. Assignments should be scanned (high-quality) pdfs. You can use an app such as Adobe Scan, and I will start to take off points if you turn in inelligible pdfs. 

You may work alone or in groups of 2. Each group will turn in a single assignment on Canvas and include your partner's name on your submission so you both receive the same grade.

## Course Policies

<br/>
### Attendance

I will not be taking attendance, so skip class at your own risk. Lecture slides will be posted on Canvas. The slides are a valuable study tool for the exams, but it will be hard to do well without regular attendance.

### Makeups

There will be no makeup tests, even if your reason for missing the test is very good. If a test conflicts with a mandatory CU event, we can arrange to have you take it before the test day, but not after. Similarly, assignments are given well ahead of their due date, so late assignments will not receive credit.

### Exams

There will be two midterms throughout the semester. They will consist of multiple choice questions along with a couple of free response questions. You may have a single piece of paper for the exams. There will be no make-up exams, unless there is documentation of a medical or family emergency. If you miss an exam, the weight of that exam will be added to the final exam. The final exam is cumulative, but the midterms are not.

### Email

Feel free to email me with questions about the course. However, if you want to talk about why you got a particular grade, you must come to office hours. Please give me 24 hours to respond before sending another email.

### Office Hours

If you have a schedule conflict during my office hours, you may email me to set up a different time to meet.

### Cheating

Donâ€™t do it, you will automatically get a zero.
