\section*{Midterm 1 Prep}

\subsection*{Supply and Demand}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The market for bike locks is described by the demand curve $P = 80 - Q_d$ and the supply curve $Q_s = 2P - 10 $. Answer the following questions:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item When the price of bike locks is \$40 how many bike locks will be demanded? How many bike locks will be produced? Why would this not be the equilibrium price? Which way will the price move in this market.

      \item What is the marginal willingness to pay for the 40th bike lock? What is the marginal cost of the 40th unit?

      \item What is the market equilibrium values of price and quantity in the market of bike locks? 
    \end{enumerate}

    \answer{
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $Q_d = 80 - P = 80 - 40 = 40$. $Q_s = 2P - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70$. This is not the equilibrium price since there is excess supply. The sellers will bid the price down.
        
        \item The marginal willingness to pay curve is given by demand, solving for $P$: $P = 80 - Q_d$. Similarly, the marginal cost curve is given by supply, solving for $P$: $P = Q_s/2 - 5$. In this case, the marginal willingness to pay is \$40 for the 40th unit and the marginal cost is \$15 for the 40th unit.
        
        \item $Q_d = 80 - P = 2P - 10 = Q_s$. This implies $3P = 90$, or $P^* = 30$. Plugging back into supply gives $Q_s = Q_d = 2*30 - 10 = 50$. Checking our work, we can plug into the demand curve and have $Q_d = 80 - 30 = 50$. 
      \end{enumerate}
    }

  \item The market contains two consumers $A$ and $B$ with the following demand functions: $Q_A^D = 40 - 5P$ and $Q_B^D = 18 - 5P$
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the aggregate demand curve for this market. Draw this curve
    
    \answer{
      $$
        Q_{mkt}^D =
        \begin{cases}
          58 - 10P & \text{if } P \leq 4 \\
          40 - 5P & \text{if } 4 \leq P \leq 8 \\
          0       & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
      $$
    }
    
    \item Let market supply be given by $Q_{mkt}^S = 2P - 2$. Solve for the equilibrium quantity and price.
    
    \answer{
      Trying $P \leq 4$, 
      $$
        58 - 10P = 2P - 2 \implies P = 5
      $$
      This doesn't work because we assumed $P \leq 4$.

      Trying, $4 \leq P \leq 8$,
      $$
        40 - 5P = 2P - 2 \implies P = 6
      $$
      This works! Pluging back into supply, $Q_{mkt} = 2 * 6 - 2 = 10$. Checking our work, $Q_{mkt}^D = 40 - 5 * 6 = 10$. 
    }
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Supply/Demand Curve Shifters}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For the following comparative static scenarios, describe what will happen the equilibrium price and quantity?
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A stimulus check makes people richer
    \item A flood wipes out wheat crops in the midwest
    \item A flood wipes out crops in the midwest \emph{and} more people start getting into bread-making
  \end{enumerate}

  \answer{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Price goes up; quantity goes up
      
      \item Price goes up; quantity goes down
      
      \item Price goes up; quantity indeterminate
    \end{enumerate}
  }
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Elasticities}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose that when the price of the new macbook is \$1,600
  per tire, quantity demanded in Boulder is 40,000. Now suppose
  that the price has fallen to \$1,400, and the quantity demanded is
  50,000. What is the price elasticy of demand? Interpret this elasticity in words.

  \answer{
    $\% \Delta \text{ in } Q = (50,000 - 40,000) / 40,000 = 0.25$

    $\% \Delta \text{ in } P = (1,400 - 1,600) / 1,600 = -0.125$

    $$
    \frac{\% \Delta \text{ in } Q}{\% \Delta \text{ in } P} = \frac{0.25}{-0.125} = -2
    $$

    To interpret, we say a 1\% increase in price yields a 2\% decrease in quantity demanded.
  }

  \item A firm increases its price from \$8 to \$12 and sees demand for the product fall by 20\%. What would the price elasticity of demand be for this product?

  \answer{$(12 - 8)/8 = 0.5$. Therefore, $\varepsilon_{Q, P} = {0.2}{-0.5} = -0.4$. To interpret, we say that a 1\% increase in price yields a 0.4\% decrease in quantity demanded.}
  
  \item If disposable incomes rise by 5\% and demand changes from 100 units to 105, what is the income elasticity of demand? Interpret this number
  
  \answer{$(100 - 105)/100 = 5\%$. Therefore, $\varepsilon_{Q, I} = {5\%}{5\%} = 1$. To interpret, we say that a 1\% increase in income increases quantity demanded by 1\%.}
  
  \item What type of good would you expected to have a negative income elasticity of demand?
  
  \answer{Inferior good. $\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial I} < 0$}
\end{enumerate}
